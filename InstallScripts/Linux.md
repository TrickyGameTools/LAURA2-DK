# Note about Linux

You may have seen that I am preparing installer scripts/programs for additional software on Mac and Windows.
This will not happen for Linux, at least not for the time being.
There are two reasons for that.

1. As compiling BlitzMax programs is a bit problematic in Linux I'm not really willing to get LAURA II running on Linux for the time being.
2. And even if LAURA II runs fine on Linux I'm also dealing with tons of different distros all with their all package managers and also compatibility issues. Since Linux lacks all forms of standardization this doesn't seem to be such a strange issue, I think. Still if you wanna help me getting LAURA II and its DK to run on Linux, and to write the 3rd party installation scripts for each distro (or at least the most common distros) well, be my guest ;)
