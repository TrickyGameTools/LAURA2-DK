# Mac Installers

My plan is to make the DK utilities ask the user about which 3rd party utilities the user desires for file editing.
For map editing this will (for now) always be Kthura (when there's only one candidate, there's only one choice).

The other software will be:
= Audacity (for audio edit)
= GIMP (for graphics edit)
= ZeroBrane Studios (for script editing)
= Geanny (for general text editing)

These apps can all be installed using home brew and a Python script will very likely be used to manage the stuff.
Please note this is all optional, the user can back out if he/she wants and the system will never ask it again.
(Well unless the configuration file is deleted, that is).
