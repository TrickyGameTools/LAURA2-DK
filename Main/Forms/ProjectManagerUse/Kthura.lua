             CSPOTS = "Kthura does allow you to put spots on the map that are very specific in meaning for your game only.\nA very nice usage of these spots was shown in 'Star Story' where the enemy spots where created with this feature.\n\nIt can allow to do more, like putting an entire series of objects near each other.\nThe transporter in Marrilona's Path of Magic dungeon are a great example of this, where a turning disc was only meant for the player's eyes, while a (for the player invisible) zone made the computer detect if Marrilona actually stepped onto the teleporter or not.\n\nStart each spot name on a new line and prefix them with a '$'. Spots not prefixed like that will be ignored.\n\nFurthermore, the Kthura editor will need to be scripted in order to make it able to know how to handle these spots.\nJust like LAURA II, Kthura uses Lua for this.",
             LINES = "Lines can be used to put some lines in the editor screen.\nI've used these lines myself as a marker for the max screen size in Star Story.\n\nIf the lines annoy you can can easily turn them off in the editor by pressing Command-L if you are on Mac, and Ctrl-L when you are on Windows.\n\nEach line need its own line and needs to be set up with this syntax <startx>:<starty>:<endx>:<endy>"
