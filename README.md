# LAURA2-DK

This is for now only a plan, and this repository was only created as a placeholder until the real works begin, which is not yet 100% sure. The point is that I know that the LAURA II engine is a pretty nice engine that I should not let go to waste.
The issue tracker/project manager here can serve to put out some ideas I had in mind.

The Engine itself has its own repository and that will remain that way. This repository will only contain a few quick utilities allowing you to quickly set things on the road, as starting up a new project in LAURA II can be a littlebit tricky, and an export utility so you can easily create a Windows and Mac version of the game. 

In order to prevent some issues with the Unix "x" attribute (which Windows does not support), it will be very likely that Mac exports will on Windows only come as ready to distribute zip files (also because some Windows users do not have full proper understanding of the .app system Mac uses and this way I can be sure all exports are correct).

A very simplistic file manager may be provided, but I'm not sure about that one yet.
